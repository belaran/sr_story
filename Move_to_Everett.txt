  Godfrey wakes up to Luci-fur sitting on his chest nuzzling in his new beard.
He goes to sit up and hits his head on the top of the coffin.  "Ugh, thought I
could rough it in here for a while" he thought to himself.  Looking at the
Emerged cat he decides it's time to start looking for someplace better for them
to stay off the radar.
  He lays back down and heads into the Matrix to review some of his old notes
on places that might work well.  Being an ex-detective has to have *some*
benefit, right?  As he's sorting through old reports and news reels he's saved
over the years he stumbles on a bit about a hotel that shuttered its doors back
in '68 and has been being run as a semi-maintained squat.  The TripleTree Inn up
in Everett.  He pulls up a file from a 5 year old report he stashed about it and
reads up on what little info was available.  Looks like a troll that goes by the
name of Colton runs the place.
  Sitting back in his VR room because it's *much* more comfortable than his
RL coffin and scratching his virtual beard, that he for some reason already
adopted, Godfrey regrets not having more Shadow contacts right now.  Looks like
he's gonna have to do this the old fashioned way and just go talk to the bloke
in person.
